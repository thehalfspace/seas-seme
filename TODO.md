Things to do (07/13):

Immediate:
- Remove unused variables and clean code.
- Add comments and quickstart guide. Add references as well.
- Mention the caveats and limitations in each code function. 
- Make struct for mesh and unpack in code.
- Solve linear system without assembly during the quasi-static step.
- Rate-state-friction: Switch the state variable \psi with \theta in the fault solvers step.
- Use NLsolve package instead of hand-written nr-search algorithm.

Later:
- Unstructured mesh.
- Add mesh refinement line along fault.
- Create different files for structured and unstructured meshes.
- Mesh coloring algorithm.
